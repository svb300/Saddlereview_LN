	 <p class=".p"> Billy Cook is a well known saddle brand. These saddles are known for being very sturdy and lasting long term. They are very comfortable, and fit well on horses. They are crafted out of genuine leather, and look very nice. There are many different makes of Billy Cook saddles. If you are looking for a good quaility saddle to have long term, this brand is worth investing in. </p>

    <img src="images/wintec.jpg" alt="Wintec" style="width:100%">
 <h2 class=".h2"> Wintec </h2>
 <p class=".p"> Wintec saddles make a great inexpensive begginer saddle. They are very lightweight, and fairly comfortable. They can last for several years, but their make is not the best. These saddles are synthetic, giving them a "plasticy-shine". The fit on horses varies with Wintec saddles. When buying one of these, check the proportions of the saddle and your horse to avoid pinching, lifting, and other issues that may occur with an ill-fitting saddle. </p>

	<h2 class=".h2">Fabtron</h2>
	<p class=".p">Fabtron saddles make great saddles for those who are looking for comfort. The Fabtron saddles prices range, so if your looking for a better saddle, but you don't want to pay 1K+ than this brand is great. The saddle make varies between both synthetic and leather, they are crafted well. These saddles fit horses fairly well, but make sure to check the proportions before ordering. These saddles are also very sturdy.</p>

<!--My opinion Column-->
<div class="columnwr">
<h4>My Opinion: </h4>
<p>I compete a lot in goat tying, barrel racing, and pole bending. Comfort is necessary, but I also need a saddle that can keep up with me. I am currently using a Billy Cook barrel saddle and it is the best saddle I have ever owned. I used to use saddles that didnt fit well, and have had many issues with them. I have learned that saddle fit and quality is more important than looks. </p>
